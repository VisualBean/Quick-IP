Taskbar IP notification application

A small utility for showing, active and inactive ipaddresses of localhost.


It shows, currently used, local IP addresses from all NICS, based on metrics in routing table and marks currently used with a green color.
If there are any changes in the connection (i.e changing from wifi to cable) the application will change its indicator instantly.
