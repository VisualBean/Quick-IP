A small utility rendered in the taskbar, for showing IP-addresses and network changes.

It shows, currently used, local IP addresses from all NICS, based on metrics in routing table and marks currently used with a green color.
If there are any changes in the connection (i.e changing from wifi to cable) the application will change its indicator instantly.
MVVM WPF

#TODO
