IPAddressNotification
=====================

Taskbar IP notification application

A small utility for showing, active and inactive ipaddresses on your local host
It shows, currently used local IP based on metrics in routing table, and marks this with a green color.
If there are any changes in the connection (i.e changing from wifi to cable) the application will change its indicator instantly
